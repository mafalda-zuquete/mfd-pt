# Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD) in European Portuguese

A repository for the Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD) in European Portuguese proposed by Mafalda Zúquete, Flávio Pinheiro, and Diana Orghian (NOVA IMS).

This MFD was developed in order to better explore the dynamics of Moral Foundations in Portuguese morality.

Initially developed in the context of a Master's thesis in Data Science and Advanced Analytics at NOVA IMS, this dictionary was created using a translation method suggested by Matsuo et. al (2019), using the original MFD proposed by Graham et al. (2009) as the source.

The proposed MFD was validated through a survey on Prolific with 324 participants, all native Portuguese speakers.

This dictionary is meant to be used in tandem with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program.
